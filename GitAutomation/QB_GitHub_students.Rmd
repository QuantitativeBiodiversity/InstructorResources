## OVERVIEW

This brief tutorial outlines how worksheets, handouts, data files, etc. are 
"pushed" to student repositories via GitHub. During QB, students will be given 
worksheets that they need to work on during class and then submit afterwards. 
The instructions below describe how to distribute and merge those documents so 
they can be evaluated. This is all done using batch scripts, which are described 
below. 

## STEP 1: SETTING UP SSH KEY

Some scripts may not work unless SSH keys are enabled.
If this is not set up on your computer already, you can do so with the following 
steps. In the terminal window generate a new SSH key with the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “your_email@example.com”
```

You will be asked to enter and re-enter a passphrase.
Alternatively, you can leave this blank. 
After that, you need to add the new key to the SSH-agent using the following 
commands, which will generate an agent pid. 

```
eval “$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

(2021: ran into problems with the `eval` command above, so skipped it and seemed
to be OK for creating key). Next you need to add your SSH key to your GitHub 
account. To obtain your SSH key, type the following command at the terminal.
(Note: your key may be named one of the following instead of id_rsa.pub: 
id_dsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub)

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
```

Now go to <https://github.com/settings/keys>. 
Click "new SSH key", make a title for your key, and paste your key into the 
"key" area, and then click the "add key" button. You will then be asked to 
supply your GitHub password. Finally, you should test your SSH key by typing 
the following in the terminal window. When asked if you want to continue, 
type "yes".

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## STEP 2: CREATE STUDENT REPOSITORIES

An instructor will need to create an upstream repository for each student in the 
QBstudents GitHub organization (<https://github.com/QBstudents>). Given that QB 
enrollment is relatively small (n = 10), this can be done manually. We've been 
making repositories "public" and have added gitignores for R and .DS_Store. Also
need to add a README file and license (GNU General Public License v3.0). In 2025,
I asked students to send me their github usernames. I then added them to their repo,
but I'm not sure this is necessary.Some of the above can be done when repos are created or later with batch script as described below. For archiving, student repos from previous years were downloaded as zip files to local computers before deleting on github. 


## STEP 3: SETUP ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE

You'll need to establish a directory that contains student folders that will be 
used to push files to their repos. In 2021, I cloned Instructor Resources 
repository in the QuantativeBiodiversity organization (see <https://github.com/QuantitativeBiodiversity/InstructorResources>).
Within, I created folders (e.g., QB2021_Fishman) for each student inside the 
GitAutomation folder, which contains batch scripts. Also in the GitAutomation 
folder is a file called `participation_repos.txt`. This file must contain all 
of the names of the students' repositories that you created. Make sure there 
are no spaces before or after names as this will create errors. Also make sure 
that repos match up with and do not contain extra info not contained in 
`participation_repos.txt`. The file should look like this:

```
QB2019_Miller
QB2019_Bolin
QB2019_Brewer
QB2019_Caple
QB2019_Crawley
QB2019_Hibbins
QB2019_Mueller
QB2019_Peckenpaugh
QB2019_Rios
QB2019_Phillips
QB2019_Test
```
Note you will also have QB2021_Test, which is for instructors use as it cannot 
be accessed by students.

## STEP 4: CLONE STUDENT REPOSITORIES TO YOUR COMPUTER

You need to clone student repositories to your local computer so you can push 
content to them. In the terminal, navigate to the location where you would like 
to set up the student repositories. Again, in 2021, Jay did this in /Users/lennonj/GitHub/InstructorResources/GitAutomation.

Now we will use the `GitCloneQB.sh` script to clone:

```
sh GitCloneQB.sh participant_repos.txt
```

This is where we ran into problems in 2017 when we did not have the SSH key 
enabled. (no issues with this in 2019 or 2021, so did not have to 
monkey with next step)

Otherwise you may try changing the following line in `GitCloneQB.sh` to work 
with html instead of ssh:

```
git clone git@github.com:QBstudents/$EachLine.git
```

## STEP 5: MERGE AND PULL FROM UPSTREAM

Before you update the student repositories (i.e., add files), you should first 
merge any pull requests that were made by students. After that, you need to pull 
(i.e., fetch + merge) changes, which might include completed worksheet; 
otherwise, you will likely encounter a conflict. The following script will 
perform a batch pull:

```
sh GitPullQB.sh participant_repos.txt
```

(There is also another file in the GitAutomation folder named `GitPullQB2.sh`, 
but it is not clear what this script does)

## STEP 6: UPDATE STUDENT REPOSITORIES 

In the following sections, we outline how to push content to the each student 
repository. You'll need to know the paths to the files you would like to push. 

### A) Make recipient directories
First, we need to make the recipient directories (e.g., `Week7-PhyloCom`) that 
you'll be pushing to with the `GitMkdirQB.sh` script. You will need to supply 
the relative path (starting from each student repository, e.g., `QB2021_Fishman`). 
So, for example, we can create a new directory with the following code at the 
Terminal:

```
sh GitMkdirQB.sh Week7-PhyloCom participant_repos.txt
```

And to create a data folder within the Week7-PhyloCom directory, you would run 
the following:

```
sh GitMkdirQB.sh Week7-Phylocom/data participant_repos.txt
```

In the following example, you could make a subdirectory ("1.Introductions") in 
each student's repository (e.g., "QB2019_Miller"), which contains a folder named 
"2.Worksheets". (In this case student repositories and GitMkdirQB.sh are in the 
same QBstudent root directory):

```
sh GitMkdirQB.sh 2.Worksheets/1.Introductions participant_repos.txt
```

### B) Copy files to newly created directory
To copy files, we'll use the `GitCopyQB.sh` script. 
This takes the following arguments: {path to file to copy} 
{path to recipient directory} {student repo list}.
For example, to copy the Phylocom assignment (replace the path to file with the 
path on your machine):

```
sh GitCopyQB.sh ~/Github/QuantitativeBiodiversity/QB-2017/
Week7-PhyloCom/PhyloCom_assignment.Rmd Week7-PhyloCom/ participant_repos.txt

sh GitCopyQB.sh ~/GitHub/QB-2021/2.Worksheets/8.BetaDiversity/8.BetaDiversity_1_Worksheet.Rmd 2.Worksheets/8.BetaDiversity/ participant_repos.txt

sh GitCopyQB.sh ~/GitHub/QB-2021/2.Worksheets/8.BetaDiversity/8.BetaDiversity_2_Worksheet.Rmd 2.Worksheets/8.BetaDiversity/ participant_repos.txt

sh GitCopyQB.sh ~/GitHub/QB-2023/2.Worksheets/6.BetaDiversity/ 2.Worksheets/6.BetaDiversity/ participant_repos.txt

# The following code will move all files and folder in the main directory over; don't need to do one-at-a-time
sh GitCopyQB.sh ~/GitHub/QB-2021/2.Worksheets/12.PhyloCom/ 2.Worksheets/12.PhyloCom/ participant_repos.txt
```


Here's what Jay did; involved frustration with not getting path exactly right
```
sh GitCopyQB.sh /Users/lennonj/GitHub/QB-2019/2.Worksheets/5.AlphaDiversity/
5.AlphaDiversity_Worksheet.Rmd 2.Worksheets/5.AlphaDiversity/ 
participant_repos.txt 
```

You can arrow-up and modify file (use option left arrow for efficiency) to 
add another file.

### C) Add and Commit Files

Now use `GitAddCommitQB.sh` script to add and commit files you just added. 
The first argument can be the path to a specific file 
(e.g., `Week6-PhyloTraits/PhyloTraits_handout.Rmd`) or a flag that git 
recognizes, e.g., `-A` for all files. The next argument is a git commit message 
(e.g., what you would normally type after `-m` in a git commit). 
Don't type `-m` though. 
Last, you'll need to supply the list of the student repositories.

Here's an example of how to add Week7 materials:

```
sh GitAddCommitQB.sh -A 'Adding Week7 Materials' participant_repos.txt
```

### D) Push to Student Repos on GitHub

Pushing to student repos is easy, just run `GitPushQB.sh` and supply the list of 
student repositories:

```
sh GitPushQB.sh participant_repos.txt
```

## STEP 7: OTHER SCRIPTS

There are a few other scripts you may need to use.
See below for descriptions on how to use them. 

### A) Remove Files 

If you need to remove a file from each student's repo, use the `GitRmQB.sh` 
script in a similar way:

```
sh GitRmQB.sh path/to/file participant_repos.txt
```

You may need to remove a file or folder that no longer exists in the QB_2019 
repo. In this case, you can just cd to the appropriate directory containing 
student repos, and for example, type the following to remove a directory. 
In this case, we're using wildcads to remove "8.Phylodiversity" from each of 
the students's repos. 

```
rm -r QB2019_*/2.Worksheets/8.Phylodiversity
```

After that, following instructions above, you would type:

```
sh GitAddCommitQB.sh -A 'removed 8.Phylodiversity' participant_repos.txt
```

and

```
sh GitPushQB.sh participant_repos.txt
```

The old phylodiversity file will now be removed from all of the students's 
repos.

### B) Moving Files

If you need to move (or rename) a file in each repo, use the `GitMvQB.sh` 
script:

```
sh GitMvQB.sh path/of/file/to/move path/of/place/to/move/it 
participant_repos.txt
```

### C) Updating .gitignore Files

To update students' gitignore files (e.g., to ignore .DS_Store files):

```
sh GitUpdateGitIgnore.sh '.DS_Store' participant_repos.txt
```
